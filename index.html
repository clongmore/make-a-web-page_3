<h1><a NAME="lesson-0">STAGE 0: The Basics of the Web and HTML</a></h1>
<h2><a NAME="lesson-0.1">Important Concepts</a></h2>

The <b>Internet</b> is a structure made up of millions of computers whose users can communicate with each other and share information.
<br>
<p>The <b>World Wide Web (WWW)</b> gives Internet users easy access to information on the Internet.
<br>
<p><b>HTML</b> is Hypertext Markup Language and it is the main, or most common, type of document on the web.  There are other types such as text, images, videos, and music.  HTML was designed to describe the contents of a web page in a very general way.
<br>
<p><b>HTTP</b> is Hypertext Transfer Protocol that sends requests to a server.
<br>
<p><b>Computers are stupid</b> because they can only do what programmers tell them to do.  The programmers have to write in a language that the computer can read.  This is referred to as <B>CODING.</B>
<h2><a NAME="lesson-0.2">Elements and Tags</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>ELEMENT: Everything within a set of <B>opening and closing tags.</B>
<li>TAG: Turns on a feature which is indicated by an <b>opening tag,</b> and turns off a feature indicated by a <B>closing tag.</B>
<li>INLINE ELEMENTS: Tags that do not require a closing tag.
<li>ELEMENTS: Tags that require a closing tag.  Block Elements are similar to an invisible box being placed around the text.
<li>ATTRIBUTE: A property of an HTML element.
<li><b>&lt;b&gt;</b>gives you <B>BOLD</B> text.
<li><b>&lt;em&gt;</b> adds <B><EM>emphasis</EM></b> such as italics.
</ul>
There are many others.  There are tags to do almost everything.  After all, <B>computers are stupid</B> and will only do what we tell them to do, so we have to talk to them in a language they can understand--<B>HTML</B>

<h1><a NAME="lesson-1">STAGE 1:  Creating Structured Documents with HTML</a></h1>
<h2><a NAME="lesson-1.1">Markup Languages and Structure</a></h2>
<p>The structure of a web page can be determined by looking at its coding or markup language.  
<p><b>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</b> is the main, or most widely used, programming language.  It controls the <b>structure</b> of a web page (how it is set up).
<p><b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)</b> is a programming language used to make the structure look like the design you were provided.  CSS controls the <b>style</b> of the HTML elements, or the way the website will look to the user.  The instructor gave a good example of cascading by using the laws of the land.  There are national laws that govern the whole nation.  From the national laws there are state laws (what you can do in a state), and from there we have city laws, county laws, and house laws.  In CSS, the most specific rules are applied to every element.  For example, the most specific rule is the house rules so it would be the same as the national laws through cascading.  Cascading keeps going down to levels until you get to the most specific rule and that rule determines the visible style for the page.
<p><B>DOM (Document Object Model)</b> is the tree-like structure of a page. This structure has a series of nested boxes, which means there are boxes within boxes, within boxes.  I can remember this concept if I think about my family tree, which is rather large.  My grandmother had nine children, my mother had nine children, and all of my siblings had children, and their children had children.  Nested elements are indented, so the more indented they are the more deeply nested the boxes are.
<p><B>DIV Tags &lt;div&gt;</b> can define boxes and help to divide other HTML elements into sections that we can treat as one whole group. Give each &lt;div&gt; tag a class element to better define the tag. 
An example would be a class attribute "TOC" which defines the Table of Contents for the page.
<br>
<h2><a NAME="lesson-1.2">The Benefits of Avoiding Repetition</a></h2>
<p>Repetition is doing the same thing over and over again, as in copying/pasting. The code is more prone to errors if, for instance, the code that was copied/pastied has to be changed.  If the change isn't made in every place where it was copied/pasted, errors can arise.  Programmers should avoid repetition at all costs, and one way to avoid it is by using <b>Inherit.</b>  This is one of the key features in CSS.
<p>With Inheritance properties are applied to a specified element as well as its descendants. Descendant elements inherit text-related properties but not box-related properties. Properties that can be inherited are color, font, letter-spacing, line height, list-style, text-alig, text-indent, text transform, visibility, white-space, and word spacing.  Inheritance allows programmers to write less CSS by preventing certain properties from being repeated over and over again.

<p>We have to use these all the time.</P>
<ol>
<li><b>Procedure Thinking:</b>  Creating very clear and explicit instructions for the computer to follow.
<li><b>Abstract Thinking:</b>  Finding generality (similarity) amongst things that seem to be different.
<li><b>Systems Thinking:</b>  Breaking big problems into small pieces.
<li><b>Technological Empathy:</b>  An understanding of how tools and systems work.
<li><b>Debugging:</b>  Systematically identifying the cause of why something isn't working.
